# Edge Detection Algorithms - Introduction to Computer Vision
## Project Description
Assignment 1 for the course Introduction to Computer Vision. This is a Python based project. This project implements an edge detection application using PyQt5, OpenCV, and NumPy. The application allows users to apply and adjust parameters for the following edge detection filters:  
- **Canny**: Lower/upper thresholds, Gaussian blur kernel size, and sigma.  
- **Sobel**: Kernel size and gradient direction (X, Y, or both).  
- **Laplacian**: Kernel size.
